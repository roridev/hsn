# welcome to hsn

this is a mere compendium of my high school notes. it will mostly be in [**portuguese**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Portuguese) since im brazilian.  


### few rules for contributing to this if youre so inclined

* capitalization is forbidden unless it is a name or a search term.
* search terms **must** be linked.
* use latex as much as possible instead of images, images are crappy and raster, tex is good and vector.
* write shit in portuguese. i dont care about anything else.

### why this mess was written in english if the whole thing is in portuguese

english is the language i think despite not being my native language and this is loosely related to code, which i write in english since im not _that_ insane yet.
